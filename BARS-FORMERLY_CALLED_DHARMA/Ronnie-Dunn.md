# Grandad's Wisdom

To know one's limitations is to know one's abilities

# Furthermore

To know where the darkness ends is to know where the light begins

# David Thorne's Wisdom

Rey uses the same darkside powers as Vader, to make more happen for the light
side.

# Josh's wisdom that John Nash could've used

Leap first, learn second. You will.

# What I've had to learn

If you try to do the right thing all the time, you need true grit

# It's enough to know

That Jesus suffered no more than he had to

On the cross

# So long as you follow Muhammad's teaching

The prophets are not the God they tell you to believe in, just a piece of him
