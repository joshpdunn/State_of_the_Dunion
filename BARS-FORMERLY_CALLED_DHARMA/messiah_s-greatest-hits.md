My favorite of Jesus's teachings is not to cast judement on a person, for no human will ever have the ultimate perspective to do so fairly.

God is the timeless collection of truth and love, much greater than you or me.

I would ask you not to send me back to the mental hospital for Picassoing Jesus, but I seem to help people there, so it's fine if you do

Do not mistake channeling divinity for possessing divinity

It is not mine to control, nor was it his

If I have hit a nerve by Picassoing Jesus, perhaps ne of our histories is incomplete.

An incomplete history does not negate a good intuition.

To understand and to share understanding...

That is all I want
