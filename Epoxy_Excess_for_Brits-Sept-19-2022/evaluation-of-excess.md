# Evaluation of excess

Was 2772 boards. Now 2772 boards x 22 APAs / 16 APAs = 2016 boards

Epoxy expires Dec 2, 2023 (144 cartridges, all others unspecified)

Total 151 cartridges

1 APA arriving per month starting early 2023

Assume 4 boards successfully assembled each time gluing is done. Doing 6 each time requires no failures and the optimization of jig availability, which requires foresight, perfect success rate, and instruction following)

Glubot has 12 seats for combs/toothstrips (interchangable names). Each board uses 2 combs. Assume each cartridge good for 4 rounds of gluing (Better insight requires the lead screw that has not come in)

2016 boards / 4 boards per run * 1/4 cartridges per run = 126 cartridges needed total after testing with these assumptions

Ideal yield with 6 successful boards per run and 4 run per cartridge is 84 cartridges

12 months with epoxy in date

126 boards per APA

12 months * 126 boards per month * 1/4 run per boards * 1/4 cartridges per run = 94.5 cartridges (63 ideal)

Consider testing needs:
94.5 cartridges * 1.33 = 125.625 cartridges
(1/3 of conservative production quantity heuristic)
...
Leaves 151 - 126 = 25 cartridges to send. Lets try harder...
