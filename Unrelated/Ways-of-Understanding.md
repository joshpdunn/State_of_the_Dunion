# Ways of Understanding

Hard things can be done. Worthwhile things to do are usually somewhat hard. Just become something is not done well does not mean it was not worth doing. Let's do this.

Should anything true be a secret forever? When context is understood (from beginning to end, front to back, top to bottom, left to right, and completely - at least so far as to understand the underlying relationships), the truth sheds light and the underlying reality is clear. When context is not understood, the truth casts shadows, and full understanding is an illusion. True things needn't stay secrets forever, though sometimes ignorance is a blessing before the truth is understood in full.

## Ways of Knowing

How can we know things we think we know? There are few things I will know in by deathbed. I should hope one of them will be that there are a few people who love me and will not stop.

No matter how hard you try to love anyone, there may still be a few who each mean everything to you, all by themselves. How can there be so many everythings in one Universe? That is one I will not try to even understand.

You won't always tell people the ways in which you go beyond caring about them. Sometimes you just have to have faith that in some way they will know. It helps if you know that you told them very clearly, and as well if there were ways which you implied it, maybe without realizing. Often, you will not know if they truly knew. You then must settle for believing they love(d) you, and that your love is no less true if they were unsure or forgetful. Sometimes it is enough to know that they are not gone, for causality goes on, and they influenced you.

The problem is we - halt - there is no problem. I will assume, for now, that *everything* is how it should be at *every* given moment. Perhaps it is so that the ultimate moment shall be perfect, but perhaps there is no ultimate moment. In life, we are never at the end: we are always in middle of the whole, at the beginning of the rest. At no moment do we *know* - by any ways of knowing which I understand - that we are at the end. If there is an infinitesimal *last moment*. We cannot wait on anything which is ultimate, if we are to begin with that which has become the beginning of the rest - the elusive present.

## Ways of Understanding

Since ways of knowing (and especially of knowing you know) are so limited in number, and we have not established any in the scope of this document (nor am I yet convinced that any exist. I cannot help but remain skeptical as of yet), it is necessary to settle for understandings.

To understand is to have a working understanding. I try never to assume that anybody, even myself has anything more. You can say "I understand" so long as you believe you understand well enough to continue forward, unlike knowing, which in the scope of everyday life, I will define as being able to have complete confidence, relative to your weighting of the criticality of your estimated uncertainty. In the scope of this document, to know is to be right, sure, and sure that you're sure, and especially to be right, by some way which reduces uncertainty entirely. It is my belief that human life is entirely too complicated to rigorously know anything important.

A map is not territory, but that does not mean that you cannot make a map that gets you where you are going (a damn good map).

What *is* impossible is to make a map that you can always trust. You can make a map which completely describes territory, and since all you have is the description, you should never equate your map with territory. There are many things which we may never be able to find "senses" (seeing, smelling, touching, measuring with a photodetector) in our lifetimes. There may be phenomena which humans will never have senses to observe, let alone come to knowledge or even understanding of. It seems very unlikely to me that anyone will make a true and complete map in my lifetime. I have set out to make a map of my map with as few assumptions as my natural born brain can filter out. If you have taken the time to read this far, *thank you*. It shows concern for clear understanding. People think I am intelligent and I do things they cannot, and that my doing does not indicate their ability. Perhaps my intelligence has some effects on my life, but what is intelligence?

One thing, and you cannot measure it nor define the virtue you are actually trying to capture when you use the concept of intelligence. Do not let intelligence define your limitations, though you may need to compassionately let your ego deflate in the case that you find that the bottle (knowledge) of motor oil (intelligence), which you so carefully put where your child (ego) would not find it (the uncertainty in all things and thus the uncertainty of the motor oil's existence), is empty and now your child has motor oil in their stomach and needs to go to the hospital. "Sorry about my kid", you might say. Motor oil's for cars, not kids.

You might find a way of looking at something somewhere you might not expect to find good wisdom. Pay attention for long enough, and the holes in your logic will be made clear when you end up somewhere...that's not on your map. The best map leads to something yet undiscovered, and thus is *not* both true and complete.
