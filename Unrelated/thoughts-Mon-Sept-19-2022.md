# Unrelated

Directory unrelated to the Glubot. Important enough to propel me to write, but not urgent.

## What will be here

Generally anything I think of which may be interesting to have another set of eyes on.

### Why?

People will seem to try to discourage you from doing things which are hard. But *anybody* who has continued living, despite the fact that *life* is hard...

has done something hard.

Hard things can be done. And just because something has been done and has not been done well...

does not mean that something was not worth doing.

I thought for a long time that thinking was not worthwhile. My parents tried to get me to do things that needed done. There are things that are worthwhile and things that need done on some level of priority, sometimes at or by a specific time, always so you can get back to what's really important, which is something like "everything, and nothing specific", so don't get caught up in the details.
