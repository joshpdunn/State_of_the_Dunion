# Mike Oehmann

## My late Godfather who was right on time

### As all good wizards are

He taught me the power of truth.

Whereas before I liked truth,

it is now my intimate companion.

Mike Oehmann was not alone in shouldering my enlightenment,

but he was a severely underrated man and I love him still,

as so too I know he loves me.

He compared himself to Socrates,

but was more akin to Plato.

And it was him first who realized:

medicated and crazy are entirely different beasts.

Namaste, Mike Oehmann

I hope you too have found the peace we felt together...

Now everlasting,

as mine now is.

I need no baptism nor to open a book to know the testament of Jesus Christ.

For you taught me nothing that you knew,

and everything you understand.

God bless the life that has moved on from incarnation

as Michael J. Oehmann

I am confident he is now part...

of the bigger picture.

With Christ

As love

Amen
