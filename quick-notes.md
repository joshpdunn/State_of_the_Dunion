# mons command
The mons command has nothing to do with the mons deferens. It allows me to enable a second monitor on arch linux + i3.

Its behavior is strange to me, so let's create a record.

09/19: Dedicated monitor is left of laptop's built-in monitor. Built-in monitor is on.
On laptop's monitor: entered command mons -e left on built-in monitor.
Dedicated monitor comes on, but is mapped right of built-in monitor, which is on. Primary monitor appears not to change, or things on built-in monitor do not move.
Entered mons -e right on built-in screen.
Entered mons on each screen to ensure that choice of monitor does not influence output

OUTPUT:

Mode: extend
1:   HDMI-1   (enabled)
2:   eDP-1-1  (enabled)

END OUTPUT
