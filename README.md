# "State of the Dunion" Progress Report Repository

## Thursday, September 15, 2022

Between the start of the semester and my move to a new apartment, I am starting to feel behind with work.

In an effort to speed up by slowing down, as well as to think less and write more, I have created this repository.

I was previously unsuccessful at sustaining written updates for very long. This time, it is helpful that my beautiful terminal editor configuration flows almost as well as my thoughts, as well as enabling me to organize my thoughts better.

I hope that you will also find this format of documentation to be a pleasant one.

I will send links to important documents when they are finished, or I can send them as files if you prefer. The github repository will also be updated with unfinished documents, if you'd like to check on progress. Files with the extension, ".md" (Markdown), will be my notes. Other files will either be embedded in or referenced in a Markdown file as supporting documents. Markdown files will be placed in folders with their supporting documents.

Feel free to ignore the contents of this directory which might be grouped as philosophy. It may be absolutely useless or you may already understand it. If you like that stuff, it'll be in "Unrelated/" (The slash indicates a directory/folder). I'll try to keep it there, but the important thing is to get it out of my system. I feel the need to explain everything, sometimes over and over in my head, until I feel I understand well enough to do something about it or let it go. I'm hoping if I write it down it'll leave me alone.

**NOTE**
The main page of the repository displays this readme file. Click "View code" to view documentation if necessary

**NOTE**
My "algorithm" (that word may still be more nuanced than I yet understand. "Yet"s are funny because "when"s implicitly include "if"s) for refraining from overpopulating this directory with notes will be to explain my habits of convention (and such) less than I think I might need to...to avoid unhelpful redundancy. Please speak up if something confuses you for more than the second it often takes to understand things, unless you are certain it is trivial and will not affect anyone else, which it cannot be. Whether or not this particular repository is ever seen by anyone is unceratin because I am populating it somewhat before it is published for the purpose for which it was intended originally by me, which is to communicate pertinent work information, though my purpose for it has already expanded beyond that. The future often reveals unintended consequences of actions which we sometimes interpret as purposes. Perhaps it is both wise and naive that we label things as such, or perhaps all thought is in vain. I suspect you may have an intuition as to what is true. I suspect we should believe in this intuition, but not add it to the list of things we know we know by ways of knowing. It would be a burden to have such a list if you only believed the things which were on it - and perhaps you would be foolish for believing completely in the things which *will* be on it, or perhaps you will merge all your lists and only think much about what you know and what you believe and to what extent your are certain, as it is so often, when it is brought up.

I digress. I seem to have wandered out of the "Unrelated" folder with ideas that are hard to digress from.

**NOTE**
There is a lot of information in this repository that might be grouped as philosophy.

**JOKE**
What is the difference between a physics professor and an English professor?

Physics and English are different names.
