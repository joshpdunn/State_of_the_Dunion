# "State of the Dunion" Progress Report Repository

## Thursday, September 15, 2022

Between the start of the semester and my move to a new apartment, I am starting to feel behind with work.

In an effort to speed up by slowing down, as well as to think less and write more, I have created this repository.

I was previously unsuccessful at sustaining written updates for very long. This time, it is helpful that my beautiful terminal editor configuration flows almost as well as my thoughts, as well as enabling me to organize my thoughts better.

I hope that you will also find this format of documentation to be a pleasant one.

I will send links to important documents when they are finished, or I can send them as files if you prefer. The github repository will also be updated with unfinished documents, if you'd like to check on progress. Files with the extension, ".md" (Markdown), will be my notes. Other files will either be embedded in or referenced in a Markdown file as supporting documents. Markdown files will be placed in folders with their supporting documents.
